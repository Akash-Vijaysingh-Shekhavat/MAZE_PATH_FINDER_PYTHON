# MAZE_PATH_FINDER_PYTHON

## Programming language used : Python

## Problem Statement:
To implement the maze path finder showing 
visualization of the game using A star algorithm 
and python .

# About 
This is a path finder visualizer.
It uses the A* algorithms for finding shortest path between start node and end note.
This A* algorithm is informed search algorithm i.e. before performing 
the search we have the knowledge related to the 
problem that knowledge is called as heuristic ,in 
this we have set the starting point and the goal .To 
implement this we will going to use the python 
programing language and the pre build modules of 
python.

 # worse case time complexity is O(E),
 where 
E is the number of edges in the graph
auxiliary space in worst case is O(V), 
where V is the total number of vertices.
Therefore,
##  O(V+E) = O(b^d)
 
where,b = Branch factor i.e. No of Children
 d = Depth
 V = Number of Nodes
E = Number of Edges
